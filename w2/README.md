# Week 2 Attendance Site
---
## Night prior
Worked on CIT 48 classwork. Talked to friends while watching whatever game they were streaming to the group. \
after finishing classwork began doing drawing practice whilst watching/streaming the *Patlabor* OVA to the group. \
Putting the series name in italics and specifying the ova feels incredibly forced. I didn't enjoy writing that. \
Knew I could have work tomorrow but went to sleep rather late because it would be the first day[^1] of the FUSD semester. \
I took screenshots of the OVA as I watched which I will include. VLC is a good media player.

## Morning
Woke up to get ready for potential work call, though already felt it wasn't going to come in.[^2] Began working on \
other classwork as well as starting to look through the work due today that I'd not gotten done yet. **Continued** \
frustrated communications with other online professor over not wanting to post my face online.\

## Now
Working on website. Ran multiple test commits to see how things would display to avoid having to learn *after* \
already writing down what I felt like including.
