            <h2>DRAGON'S HEAVEN</h2>
            <div>
                <p>Dragon's Heaven is an OVA I've found myself very entranced by, while not to the point of <br>
                obsession, as with some others, the heavy moebius inspiration in its designs and direction <br>
                combined with the passion shown in it's production and how it expands on <br>
                Makoto Kobayashi's original, very short, comic is the exact kind of thing that'll <br>
                easily draw me into anything. </p>
            </div>

                    <p>
                        This aforementioned passion is immediately <br>
                        shown in the opening of the OVA, choosing <br>
                        to start with a 5 minute long presentation <br>
                        of a physical model of the main robot in the <br>
                        video. <br>
                        Important to note: This model only contributes <br>
                        to these 5 minutes of the 40 minute long video.

                        I think I misplaced this one. Not a problem, <br>
                        as this scene is another example of the sort <br>
                        of personality given to the main robot, <br>
                        and the kind of charm it grants him <br>
                        in spite, or partially because of <br>
                        his nature as a decaying war machine.

                        A shot of the main villain of the <br>

                        texture on the metals, it's all very Moebius.

                        I don't actually remember what was going on <br>
                        in this scene actually. I just really like <br>
                        this smaller robot guy's design. The tall head <br>
                        on him is another very Moebius design choice.

                            I lied about the model not contributing<br>
                            after the first 5 minutes! <br>
                            It comes back once the entire OVA <br>
                            complete and the plot has wrapped up <br>
                            to provide some viewing material in <br>
                            the credits as footage of it's <br>
                            construction is shown over the names <br>
                            of people involved in it's creation. Cute! <br>

            <h1>LUPIN THE 3RD</h1>
            <p>
                Lupin is a long running series that I've been very lightly into. I keep meaning to <br>
                watch more of the movies but I often forget to. The movies contain heavily varied <br>
                tones and stories, which makes them a bit hard to explain since characters can act <br>
                in completely different ways based on the movie, adhering to a few base traits, <br>
                Lupin himself in particular ranging from a straightforward hero in some movies <br>
                to a villain who's only followed because his name is on the cover in some others. <br>
                The best way I can describe them is like a strange cross between James Bond and <br>
                Scooby Doo. <br>
                While Cagliostro is the most popular movie in the series, I'm very fond of <br>
                The Mystery Of Mamo, the movie immediately preceding it. Though, as I've said before, <br>
                I've not really watched much of the movies in total... <br>

                I've read the comics and watched the shows though!

                    Not much to say about this one. <br>
                    One of the more energetic parts of <br>
                    the movie, coming in during the first half. <br>
                    Just a nice shot of Lupin and Jigen laughing <br>
                    after escaping a chase.

                <p>
                    A cool scene pre-empting Mamo's first meeting <br>
                    with Lupin. There are several shots like this <br>
                    at this point in the movie, this one <br>
                    in particular catching my eye for how much <br>
                    it felt like it pushed the lonely feeling <br>
                    the movie had throughout it.

                <p>
                    One of the last scenes Jigen and Daisuke get <br>
                    before they leave for about half of the <br>
                    movie's runtime. <br>
                    They come back at the end though.

                    There's really not much to say about this one. <br>
                    I just always love a funny fisheye shot.
